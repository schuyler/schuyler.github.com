<h1>Hi, I'm Schuyler!</h1>
<div><b>Summary: </b>My name is Schuyler Erle. (That’s
    pronounced <i>sky-ler</i>, if you’re curious.) I’m 39 years old, cis male,
    and single. I’ve been living in San Francisco for the last 7 years, and I love
    it here. I work a professional job at a technology startup in the Mission.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
    I’m smart, funny, compassionate, and personable. I’d like to find
    open-minded, mature, and socially conscious housemates to share an
    apartment or house here in the city.</div>
</div>

<div style="text-align: right"><br/></div>
<div><b>Job:</b> I work as the Head of Engineering at Orion, a startup in the
    Mission which builds voice communication technology. I've worked at other
    startups previously, and have done both professional and volunteer work in
    community mapping and disaster relief. I also wrote a book about maps a
    long time ago for O’Reilly (the kind with the animals on the covers).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Politics:</b> I am a dedicated feminist and queer ally. I am non-monogamous and unabashedly sex-positive. I care a lot about political and social justice. I would prefer to live with people who feel similarly, or who are at least tolerant. :)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Activities:</b> My main hobbies are backcountry hiking and taekwondo. I have also enjoyed rock climbing, cycling, sailing, scuba diving, and I think I want to learn to hang glide. I’m interested in building art projects with software. I like to read a lot, particularly about history, science, or science fiction. I am an amateur astronomer, and, if I ever had a second career, it would be in astrophysics. I used to ride a motorcycle and I plan to get another one eventually.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Schedule:</b> I’m in the office 10-6 and sometimes later, most weekdays. I go out with friends some weeknights. I try to dedicate weekends to spending time outdoors.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Food:</b> I am omnivorous. I enjoy cooking dinner a lot, and would even be glad to cook for roommates a few times a week, assuming you can stand my cuisine. I really love barbecue grilling, if there’s outdoor space. I like having a clean and tidy kitchen.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Shared space:</b> I have no pets and don’t smoke. I don’t own a lot of
    furniture I plan to keep. I like to keep common spaces tidy and
    clutter-free. Truthfully, I do find it a challenge to make time to do deep
    cleaning, and prefer to hire a housekeeper for that once a month or so. I
    like gardening when there’s space outdoors.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Social life:</b> If desired, I will <i>always</i> try to offer advance
    notice and get consent before having guests over, which isn’t super
    often. I enjoy hosting dinner parties or board game
    nights periodically. I do like having big house parties or barbecues every
    once in a while. I would like to have the option of having out-of-town
    guests visit for a few days, <i>but</i> again only with notice and your consent. I
    drink alcohol socially and I'm not bothered by other people smoking pot or
    other casual drug use.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Noise level:</b> I enjoy listening to music and playing acoustic guitar, but I am happy to negotiate appropriate volumes and times of day! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Style:</b> I do my best to be a respectful housemate and to be mindful of the needs and interests of my neighbors. I am pretty easy-going about most things home-related. I try really hard to be self-aware and responsible to the people around me. I strive for clear, compassionate, and supportive communication with my housemates. After all, we’re sharing a home, right?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>What I'm looking for:</b> A bedroom with high ceilings and a lot of light, within a couple miles of the Mission District. A kitchen with a dishwasher and laundry facilities on the premises. Friendly, responsible housemates. Some reasonable place to store my camping gear. The rest is negotiable. :)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Please feel free to contact me on the Gmails at schuyler.erle. I look forward to hearing from you!</div>
