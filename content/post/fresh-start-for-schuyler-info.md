It's a fresh start for schuyler.info!

No, I don't need another blog. No one _needs_ another blog.

What I need is a place to take notes and keep a journal of some of my current
technical projects. Almost entirely stuff I'm doing for fun.

I figure maybe it'll show up in Internet searches when someone is trying to
solve the same problems I'm working on. Probably it will be me. Most likely it
will.

I can only hope it will be useful to you too.
